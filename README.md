## SharePoint SPFx CRUD

SharePoint framework webpart for performing CRUD operations using JavaScript.

I have made a POC on how to create a SPFx webpart with NoJavascript for achieving all the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on SharePoint list.

My attempt is to help out all the new developers working on SharePoint Framework and developer community working out.

Please help out in improving the code, all your comments and feedbacks are valuable to me.

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean - TODO
gulp test - TODO
